The GWAS Catalog's REST API 2.0, data release 2026-10-29 (its `metadata` endpoint's `data_release_date`). Each
record named here is cached by `loci fetch-supp` as `associations-<rsID>.json`, one object a line; each quote is a
line of it as cached. A catalog association is the catalog's own curation of a paper, not a second study.
